# FPGA_RLE
Write Verilog for custom designed state machine. Implement hardware for Run-Length Encoding

The system designed is Run length encoding which we encode 8 bit data stream segments into 24 Bit data which consist of first ID bit and 23 bits count value. At the end, I writed new testbench file.

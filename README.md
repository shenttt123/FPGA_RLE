Write Verilog for custom designs. Implement hardware for Run-Length Encoding

First, I created new resource library in Modelsim for the design, put it in there and then compile it. The system we need to design is Run length encoding which we encode the 8 bit data stream segments into 24 Bit data which consist of first ID bit and 23 bits count value. At the end, I write new testbench file which created in testbench folder separately.

Here's the demo video
